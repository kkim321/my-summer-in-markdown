# Summer 2024 - Kailyn

## Summer Activities

One activity I did throughout the whole summer was doing my first job. I worked at my parent's boba store for two months and since there is a Planet Fitness Gym next to it, I went there for 3-4 days a week. I ended up getting a good amount of money for me to buy things on my own. Another activity that I did was that I went to my church's summer retreat. There were many activites and  delicious food! I had a lot of fun and met new people which I enjoyed hanging out with.

## Learning Experiences

Since I worked at a boba place, I learned how to make boba drinks and learned a lot of recipies for the drinks. Not only making drinks, but also restocking desserts, ingridients, fruits, etc... I also learned how to do POS and found out how to work the register for the payments. This also helped me experience to have good customer service and helped me a lot for future jobs that I may have.

## Goals for the School Year

One goal I have for my senior year is that I want tofinish my college apps as soon as possible. I also want to get straight A's and pass some of y AP exams with a 4. After college apps are done, I hope to get into the colleges I want, specifically, UCLA, UC San Diego, and UC Chicago. Overall, I want to have a fun senior year, make good last memeories of highschool and graduate with a stoll.

## Favorite Summer Memory with Friends

My favorite memory with my friends during the summer was in my summer retreat. We weren't able to use our phones for 4 days, so that allowed us to just talk and hangout without any electronics. I enjoyed spending time with them as we bonded together and grew closer. We shared a lot of fun momemnts together filled with laughter as well as some sentimental moments where we vented to each other. Overall, I had a great time with them during those 4 days and am looking forward to my next church retreat with them!
